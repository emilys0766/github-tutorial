## Git vs. GitHub
Both Git and Github are version control systems (a system used to tracks changes made in repositories), and use similar commands to create and make changes to repositories. However, there are some differences between the two:
| Git  | Github |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|  - Git uses 'snapshots' to record code, and does not need Github in order to function. | - Unlike Git, Github can save any code in a cloud (you have access to it whenever you want), show what changes are made inside of the code, and can be shared with others to work on projects. Although Git does not need Github, Github requires Git.|
